Run: ba4c5495-d1cc-4c6a-93f7-490019ebea73
Task: turds-with-friends - Complete premium access
Started: 2026-02-10

## Codebase Patterns
- Testing: Jest with Next.js integration
- Mock pattern for Supabase: Use jest.mock('@/lib/supabase/server', ...)
- Tests in __tests__ folder or alongside source files with .test.ts suffix
- Use `// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` for intentionally unused destructured props

## 2026-02-10 - US-004: Update lib/premium.ts to return true for all users
- Modified `src/lib/premium.ts` to return `Promise<true>` for all users
- Preserved original Supabase subscription check in comment block for future reference
- Added clear documentation explaining universal premium access
- Created `src/lib/premium.test.ts` with 6 tests covering:
  - Various userId formats (normal, empty, UUID, random string)
  - Async function signature verification
  - Parameter acceptance
- Build passes with minor warnings
- All 6 new tests pass
- **Learnings:** Project uses standard Jest with Next.js. Underscore prefix for unused vars triggers unused eslint-disable directive warning.

## 2026-02-10 - US-005: Enable location tracking in LogForm for all users
- Modified `src/components/log/LogForm.tsx`:
  - Removed conditional `{isPremium ? (...) : (...)}` block for location section
  - Kept only the premium-styled UI (amber colors, PremiumBadge) for all users
  - Changed `if (isPremium && trackLocation && logData)` to `if (trackLocation && logData)`
  - Added eslint-disable comment for intentionally unused isPremium prop
- Created `src/components/log/LogForm.test.tsx` with 10 tests covering:
  - Location section UI shows premium styling for all users
  - PremiumBadge is displayed
  - No upgrade button shown
  - No disabled gray state
  - Toggle functionality works
  - Location captured when toggle enabled
  - Location NOT captured when toggle disabled
  - Works for all users regardless of premium status
  - Visual consistency between premium and non-premium users
- Build passes
- All 10 new tests pass (42 total tests passing)
- **Learnings:** When removing conditional UI that used a prop, the prop becomes unused. Use eslint-disable comment or remove the prop from the interface (but keeping it maintains API compatibility).

## 2026-02-11 - US-003: Create Privacy Policy page
- Created `src/app/(marketing)/privacy/page.tsx` with comprehensive Privacy Policy content:
  - Hero section with legal badge and last updated date (February 11, 2025)
  - Sticky sidebar navigation with 9 jump links to all policy sections
  - 9 comprehensive policy sections: Information We Collect, How We Use Information, Data Storage & Security, Your Rights, Cookies, Third Parties, Children's Privacy, Changes to Policy, Contact
  - Related documents section linking to Terms, Medical Disclaimer, and Contact pages
  - Full metadata with title (33 chars), description (155 chars), Open Graph, and Twitter Card
  - JSON-LD structured data (WebPage schema) with isPartOf WebSite reference
  - Used prose classes for readable legal text typography
  - Proper JSX escaping with &quot; and &apos; for quotes and apostrophes
  - All sections use scroll-mt-24 for proper scroll offset
- Created `src/app/(marketing)/privacy/page.test.tsx` with comprehensive tests:
  - Page structure tests (rendering, footer inclusion)
  - Hero section tests (title, legal badge, date, icon)
  - Sidebar navigation tests (all 9 links present)
  - Policy sections tests (all 9 sections with subsections)
  - Related documents section tests
  - Metadata tests (title length, description 150-160 chars, Open Graph, Twitter Card)
  - JSON-LD structured data tests
- Build passes with minor warnings
- All 21 new privacy page tests pass (187 total tests passing)
- **Learnings:** Use getAllByText for text that appears in both sidebar links and section headings. Keep descriptions under 160 characters for SEO. Use sticky positioning with top-24 for scrollable sidebars.
